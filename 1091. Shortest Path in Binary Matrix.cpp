/*
The priority_queue pq in this code does not directly take its contents from 'grid'. Instead, the pq is used to store cell coordinates along with their corresponding distances.

The algorithm uses the pq to explore the cells in the grid and determine the shortest path. It starts by pushing the starting cell's coordinates (0, 0) into the pq with a distance of 0.

Then, in the while loop, it repeatedly pops the top cell from the pq, retrieves its coordinates and distance, and performs certain operations based on the cell's properties.

When exploring neighboring cells, the algorithm calculates the coordinates of these cells based on the current cell's coordinates. It checks if the neighboring cell is within the grid bounds and is unblocked (contains 0) in the grid. If so, it calculates the distance to the neighboring cell and pushes the neighboring cell's coordinates and updated distance into the pq.

So, the pq is not directly populated with the contents of the grid. It uses the grid information to explore cells and determine their distances, and then stores these cell coordinates and distances in the pq for further processing.
